Bug type: incorrect handling of negative indices

Description:
The buggy implementation treats any negative index as out of range, returning
the default value. However, Python lists support negative indices to access
elements from the end. The fixed version checks that the index is between
-len(lst) and len(lst) - 1, and returns default only when the index is truly
out of range.
