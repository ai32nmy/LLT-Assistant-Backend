Bug type: wrong parity condition for even numbers

Description:
The buggy function checks v % 2 == 1, which selects odd numbers, but still raises
an error saying there are no even numbers if none are found. The fixed version
uses v % 2 == 0 to correctly accumulate even numbers in both total and count.
