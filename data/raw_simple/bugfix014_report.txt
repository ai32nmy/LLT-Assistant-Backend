Bug type: missing tail append in merge of sorted lists

Description:
The buggy implementation merges elements only while both lists have remaining
items, but never appends the leftover elements from either list. The fixed
version adds two loops to append the remaining elements from a or b, ensuring
the merged result contains all inputs.
