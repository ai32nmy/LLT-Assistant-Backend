Bug type: incorrect median selection after partial sorting

Description:
The buggy algorithm performs two comparisons and then returns c, assuming c is
the median. This is not always true. A simple example is a=3, b=1, c=2.
After the swaps, c may end up as the maximum rather than the middle. The fixed
version performs three comparisons so that a <= b <= c holds, and then returns b
as the median.
