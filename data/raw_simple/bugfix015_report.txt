Bug type: collapses multiple spaces when converting to title case

Description:
The buggy version skips empty words produced by split(" "), which collapses
multiple spaces into a single space in the output. The fixed version preserves
empty segments in result_words so that joining them with " " keeps the original
spacing while still capitalizing the first letter of each non-empty word.
