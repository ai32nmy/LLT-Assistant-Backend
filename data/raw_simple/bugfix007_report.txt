Bug type: string slice excludes last character in palindrome check

Description:
The buggy version compares s[:-1] (all characters except the last) with the
reverse of the full string. This can produce incorrect results, especially for
single-character strings or when the last character is different. The fixed
version compares the whole string s with s[::-1].
