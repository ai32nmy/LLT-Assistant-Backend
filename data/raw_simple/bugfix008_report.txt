Bug type: wrong container used to track seen elements

Description:
The buggy implementation checks x not in result instead of x not in seen.
Although in this specific pattern result and seen happen to stay the same, this
is logically wrong and brittle. In more complex refactors it can easily break.
The fixed version uses seen consistently as the membership check structure.
