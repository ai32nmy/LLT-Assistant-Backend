ID: bugfix001
Bug type: off-by-one in loop bound

Description:
The buggy version iterates with range(n + 1), summing n + 1 elements when enough
items are available in the list. The fixed version correctly uses range(n) so
that exactly the first n elements are summed. For example, nums=[1,2,3], n=2
should give 3, but the buggy code returns 6.
