Bug type: first element is skipped when computing maximum

Description:
The buggy implementation initializes current_max with values[1], ignoring
values[0]. If the largest element is at index 0, it will never be considered.
The fixed version correctly initializes current_max with values[0] and iterates
over the remaining elements.
