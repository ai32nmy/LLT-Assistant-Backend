Bug type: incorrect handling of 1 and even numbers in primality test

Description:
The buggy version incorrectly returns True for n <= 1 and for all even numbers.
This makes many composite numbers prime. The fixed version properly treats
n <= 1 as non-prime, returns True only for n == 2 among even numbers, and
rejects other even values.
