Bug type: division by zero when all elements are zero

Description:
If all elements are zero, max_abs remains 0.0 and the buggy implementation
divides by max_abs, causing a ZeroDivisionError. The fixed version explicitly
checks for max_abs == 0.0 and returns a list of zeros in that case instead of
dividing by zero.
